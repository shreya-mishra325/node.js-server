ðŸŒ¤ Node.js Weather API Server 

A basic weather backend built using vanilla Node.js â€” a lightweight weather API server built entirely with Node.js built-in modules â€” no frameworks like Express were used. It serves as a backend-only application that fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, based on a city name provided via the query parameter.
